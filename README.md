# AmbidexteriousBounce
Code of the paddle game from the book "python for  kids" by Jason R.Briggs

I added an extra ball and paddle for a challenge
The Game still crashes when the ball hits the bottom canvas
Balls need more speed as time progresses
Needs more levels
You also have to click on the screen to start the game

This was a learning exercise, never got time to actually finish it off
